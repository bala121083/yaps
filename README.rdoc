= YAPS

==== An object-oriented JavaScript framework for Facebook

Yaps is a JavaScript framework that aims to ease development of dynamic 
web applications under Facebook Application plateform.  

It's deeply inspired form the Prototype framework (http://prototypejs.org) for 
the basic common features and form Sriptaculous library (http://script.aculo.us/)
for the specific classes.

=== Targeted platforms

We try to make our codes usable on every plateforme.
For now, it has been tested only on :

* Mozilla Firefox 3
* Apple Safari 3.1.2

== Using Yaps

To use Yaps in your Facebook application, download the latest release from the 
Yaps web site (http://labs.sociabliz.com/yaps) and copy javascript files to a 
suitable location. Then include it in your HTML/FBML like so:

  <script src="/path/to/base.js"></script>

If you need special feature like drag & dropping classes, inlude them after de 
base.js file like so :

  <script src="/path/to/dragdrop.js"></script>

== Contributing to Yaps

  $ git clone git://github.com/meuble/yaps.git


For now, we prefere that you fork the git repository and submit merge request.

== Documentation

Ther isn't any Yaps specific documentation.

Scriptaculous documentation to find out how Yaps works.
